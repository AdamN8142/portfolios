# (Adam-Niedzwiecki) - (M1) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis
My goal going into Mod1 was to pass Mod1. Although i did not acomplish that goal, i have realized it was the wrong goal for me. My new goal is to understand all the information given to me and be job ready when i leave Turing. Throughout the mod i learned more than i had ever thought possible. Having no prior coding exeperience, i now feel comfortable with HTML, CSS, and JS. I enjoyed the solo projects and the pair projects and feel like i will get more from them the second time around.

## Rubric Scores

## A: End of Module Assessment

Repeat, but solid effort.

## B: Individual Work & Projects
I felt like i did well on all of my individual projects. Each time i was able to seek out resources that helped me gain the knowledge to succeed. 

#### (NUMBER GUESSER)

We built a game where the user was to guess a number between 1-100. Each time the user submitted a guess, we would return a message telling the user to gueds higher or lower. If the number was guessed correctly, BOOM! They got it

* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html)



Not a great overall first static comp, watch spacing and choose better colors that dont clash and have distinct break points


 

 #### (STATIC COMP 2)
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/AdamN8142/an-comp-challenge-2)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html)



Much better than last time! Good spacing, pay attention to fonts and colors




#### (STATIC COMP 3)
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/AdamN8142/an-static-comp-3)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-3.html)

Incomplete - good static view before the squish



## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

(Working with Sabrin and Paul really helped me comprehend the material. Sabrin was a great teacher and i think we learned a lot together through the project. Paul and i battled this project til to the end! My project with Mariel ended abruptly due to unfortunate circumstances, but we were off to a good start and i think we would have made a good team.)

#### (IDEA BOX)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/AdamN8142/idea-box)

* [Evaluation Comments ](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1808/mod-1/idea-box/paul-adam.md)

Using local storage, we saved data that our user inputs

Re-factoring a students project following a set ot strict refactoring guidelines


## D: Community Participation
It took a little while to get into the swing of things but after a few weeks i completely bought in to what Turing was selling. The community aspect of Turing plays a big part in ones success. Meeting students in upper mods and expressing our thoughts and feelings during PD is a great break from the heavy Turing pace.


### Playing a Part
One area i did not lack in this Mod was forming friendships with my the students in my cohort. I can honestly say i made a point to reach out to everyone in our mod as a potential resource, but more imortantly, a friend. The hardest part about repeating will be leaving my new friends.
