# Adam Niedzwiecki - (M1) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This mod i set out to grasp all the concepts that i was shaky on during my first mod. I wanted to reinforce my CSS/HTML skils and build on JS fundamentals. Even more than that, i wanted to be comfortable with being uncomfortable. I found ways to deal with my stress and not let it have as big of an effect on me as it did my first time in Mod-1. I was also determined to help others. Having been through the mod, I knew that it would be a tough transition for those with no prior coding experience. I would like to believe i accomplished that and was able to pass on a lot valuable information to others in my cohort.

## D: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

Having gone through this experience already, i know how stressful it can be. During this mod i tried to lend a helping hand whenever possible. I shared all of the insight i had to help ease my classmates worries. These little things can really help when working at such a rapid pace. I stayed late almost every day and always offered advice/what to expect to my classmates when were assigned a new project or introduced to a concept that i knew would become a staple in Mod-1. I also used Slack a fair amount to check in on those that looked like they were having a tough time. I also did my best at introducing the students in my class to my old classmates. I knew who would work well together and i suggested for those people to pair.
